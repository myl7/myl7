# Hi, this is Yulong Ming!

-   My name is Yulong Ming in English and 明宇龙 in Chinese.
    I usually use myl7/myl7s/myl7s1 as my usernames, depending on the username length limits and availability.
-   I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong (2022-26), working on Network Security
-   I work on free and open-source software (FOSS) projects, contributing on GitHub.
    I believe [even once is help](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/saying-no-even-once.html), and do run Arch Linux for my daily work.
